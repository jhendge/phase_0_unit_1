# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have any "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It's not a programming language, rather, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages. If a web page is a document and a document can be displayed in a browser window or as HTML source code (same document in both cases), then what the DOM does is provide another way to represent, store, and manipulate the same document. It's a fully object-oriented representation of the web page and it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

2. Compared to a wordpress.com site, my site looked elementary. It included fewer elements to style and a total lack of JavaScript. In additon, the wordpress.com site had a ton of inherited css elements and a more robust stylesheet in general.

3. I thought working with Chrome Dev Tools was fun, helpful, and awesome. What a powerful tool! I've seen other people use it for years and have always wanted to know what exactly it could do. Now that I know a little bit about it, I want to know more. I want to know what I can do in the "Timeline," "Resources," and "Profiles," among others.

4. I had many "aha" moments during this sesction. I felt like the whole Code School DevTools course was one big "aha" moment. Just being able to examine and change live websites in real time is just so cool and it made me want to continue to learn about it. I really enjoyed playing with sites' CSS and testing what elements did what. I don't usually like to make a mess but with DevTools, it feels safe because you can simply reload the page and "poof," you can start over.

5. I thought phpacademy's YouTube series on DevTools had some good info (including how to "detach" the tools from the bottom of your sceen and into a seperate window). https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL201CED3354560079
