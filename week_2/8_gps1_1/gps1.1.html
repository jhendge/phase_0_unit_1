        <h5>Why Pair Program?</h5>
        <p>To Ryan and myself, programming is essential because it reflects
          skills needed in the real world and because it's an excellent way to master new material.
          Modern software is created by teams of people, not one person sitting in solitude. 
          It's a social experience, thus it is vital to get practice in learning with others.
          In addition, programming in pairs allows for pairs to bounce questions and ideas off of each other. 
          This exercise makes learning concepts easier as it provides an opportunity
          to gain a second perspective.

        <h5>What is Driving and Navigating?</h5>
        <p>When it comes to programming in pairs, it is a generally accepted practice that on partner assume the
           role as the driver and the other as the navigator. The driver's primary rresponsibility is to type out
           the code and stay focused on the lines being executed. The navigator focuses on the big picture and helps direct 
           the flow of the code. Both roles should focus on communication and be sure to bounce questions and ideas off of one another.
