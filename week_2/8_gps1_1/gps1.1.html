      <h5>Why Pair Program?</h5>

      <p>To Garrett and myself, programming is essential because it reflects skills needed in the real world and because it's an excellent way to learn the material.
        Modern software is created by teams of people, not one person sitting in solitude. It's a social experience, thus it is vital to get practice in learning with others.
        In addition, programming in pairs allows for pairs to bounce questions and ideas off of each other. This exercise makes learning concepts easier as it provides an opportunity
        to gain a second perspective.

      <p>When it comes to programming in pairs, it is a generally accepted practice that one partner assume the role as the driver and the other as the navigator.
      The driver's primary role is to type out the code and stay focused on the lines being executed. The navigator focuses on the big picture and helps direct 
        the flow of the code. Both roles should focus on communication and be sure to bounce questions and ideas off of one another.
