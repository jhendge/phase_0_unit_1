# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. I learned that there is much more to user experience than simply how a web site/application looks. UX designers must invoke an experience with a certain feeling, so they are thinking about much more than color schemes and placement. They are thinking about sub-systems and processes within a system (i.e. the checkout process of an e-commerce website) and examining what, if anything, makes a particular system efficient or pleasurable for a user.

2. I have been fascinated with design concepts for years so I really enjoyed delving into this week's materials. I loved working on my site and only wish I could've spent more time playing with CSS and continuing to style my page. The one piece I'm not yet a huge fan of is wireframing. I typically have a general concept of what I want to design but like to keep it a bit open-ended so that I can change things as I go along. I tried to stay true to my wireframe but ended up making slight changes when I finally made it to the HTML.

3. I have been continuing to refine my process ever since we began our HTML/CSS work. I keep a rough idea in my head of what I want to design and then begin writing a quick outline of the HTML. When I reached a point where I felt like I had bulked up my code enough, I began piecing together CSS elements and adding some style. I kept going back and forth between the HTML and CSS until the site was eventually stitched together. That approach felt natural but as mentioned previously, I veered a little bit from my wireframe so I'd like to continue to see how I can improve my pre-coding process.

4. I would like to position my "week one" and "week two" containers so that they are centered and also include links to my Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and GitHub profiles.

5. It took me a while to apply the concept of @font-face to my HTML and CSS because I read varying tutorials which outlined slightly different code. Once I saw the "Women in Computing" site change from its standard font to one I download from Google fonts, I rejoiced. It was really cool to see it work. 

6. This was pretty friendly and useful for learning concepts --> http://www.uxapprentice.com/
