# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. I'm impressed that with so many different browser types, screen sizes, operating systems, etc. that there are still web standards that are applicable. I think it's a good thing because it allows for customization within a framework that is easily digestible and understood by the masses. If everyone did their own thing and didn't take into account a variety of users, then a group of people might miss out on something because web standards weren't recognized.  

2. The standard structure of divs, spans, etc. doesn't make a ton of intuitive sense because in reality, what really is a span? What is a div? I can't recite those to a non-technical person and have any expectation that he/she would have any idea what those are. On the other hand, if I were to ask that same person to describe a header, footer, or section, he/she would have a much easier time of describing those elements because there would be an expectation of prior exposure. 

3. I think the new HTML5 elements just make more sense. As a new programmer entering the field, I draw back on my prior experiences in school and exposure to different fields to understand what a header, footer, and even nav are. There is already a base understanding and using these new terms doesn't compromise the basic premise: organize HTML docs into something usable and something that makes sense. To me, these terms make more sense intrinsically.

4. Reset.css is necessary because it allows ALL viewers, regardless of browser, configuration, etc. to be able to view a particular website in the same fashion. Different browsers style things differently; reset.css essentially ensures that all browsers view a page the same way.

5. I've used IE, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Chrome Canary, and perhaps others when I was a wee lad. Forgive me for sounding so childish but I actually think it's fun that sites look different in different browsers. I'm a huge proponent of aesthetics so the variety of styles used by different browsers creates unique experiences. Using Chrome feels different than using IE or Firefox. Opera is different than all of the aforementioned. I like it because people tend to gravitate towards what their needs and desires are. I think of it as a burger shop... there are many varieties and choices to make but ultimately one that best suits you.
