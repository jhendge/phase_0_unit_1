# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. Responsive web design allows for websites to be viewed on a myriad of screen sizes without having to code a different version of the site for each individual screen. Rather than asserting whether this is a "good" or "bad" practice, I'd like to say that this seems necessary. It would be foolish to spend the time and energy redesigning the same website for hundreds of screen sizes when responsive design is an adequate solution. It's really some brilliant stuff. Cheers to Ethan for this one!

2. Smartphones and tablets have forced web designers to be contentious of how a particular site is experienced across many different platforms. A site shouldn't look and feel drastically different from platform to platform, so designers have to not only design differently, but think differently as well. In the future, surely their will be an iteration of responsive design that will cater to the growing landscape of hardware devices and/or virtual reality capabilities. The space is only continuing to grow.

3. I feel a bit silly saying that I'm not entirely sure how visually impaired feel use the web (because I don't!) but my guess would be that there are a number of voice commands that can be used to pull info from sites. It might not make the most economic sense to spend the time and energy customizing a site for a very small percentage of web users but I think we should design with the visually impaired in mind. They deserve to have a rich web experience like the rest of us. It is part of our job to deliver that.

4. I've been fascinated with responsive web design for a little while now and never cease to be amazed by what design solutions have been implemented on smartphones in particular. For a news site like the BBC to be able to present high volume content on a small screen in a tasteful way is nothing short of impressive.
