# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

1. My biggest time management challenge during Phase 0 is trying to work diligently so as to get caught up ASAP while also absorbing as much information as possible. When I work alone, I tend to be a slow, thorough worker so I always know to build in more time than is generally recommended. 

2. In order to combat this, I have tried to be increasingly mindful of not spending too much time on any one challenge or reflection. If I can sense that I'm having a sluggish day or am just not in the right mindset to work, I'll set a timer and create mini deadlines so that I'm forced to produce work no matter what.

3. One thing I've noticed over the course of the last couple weeks is that I need to get more sleep and be more contentious of my eating habits. There are times when I'll be working and notice I've missed lunch by hours or that I'm working late into the night and not compensating by waking up later the next day. I think in order to be a better worker, I need to actually do a better job of taking care of myself.

4. My overall plan for Phase 0 is to finish week two work today (Friday, May 30) and begin week three. I might have to do week three out of order so that I can participate in the group challenge immediately. It looks like I will focus on JavaScript first and then do the git challenge. I hope to be done with week three stuff by the middle of next week so that I can jump on week 4 and get caught up by the end of next week. I have my last spring/summer obligation this weekend (an event for my baby niece) so I will have no issues finding time after Sunday.
