## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://jhendge.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I really did enjoy creating my blog template. I spent more time tooling around with the CSS than I should have, but I'm pleased with the finished product considering I learned how to use CSS less than a week ago. 

I found the blog helpful in solidifying what I know in CSS and identifying areas where I still need work. I feel like there is so much I can do with CSS and that I'm only beginning to scratch the surface. I'm excited to see what's ahead.

I almost had a brief meltdown towards the end of the blog experience when I was trying to link my index.html page to my blog and the CSS appeared broken. I reached out on the Google+ community page and received help in the form of a notice that I was actually linking my blog to my computer, not my repo on Github. Crisis averted!
