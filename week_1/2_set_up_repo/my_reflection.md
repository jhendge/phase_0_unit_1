## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. If I were describing the process of creating a repository and cloning that repository (repo) to a non-technical person's local computer, I would first describe what creating a repo is and what cloning a repo to a local computer really means and why it's important. I would explain that a repo is essentially a folder for code that lives in your Github account and then describe the process of actually creating a repo from Github (click on the "+" in the upper-right hand corner and scroll to "New repository"). I would then describe the pros and cons of keeping the repo public or private, then briefly describe the usefulness of licenses (more on that in the responses below) and why it might be important to include one. After copleting the process of creating the repo, I would explain that in order to actually send or edit files to that repo, it is necessary to clone, (or "copy") it to a local computer. The non-technical person and I would then download Github for Mac, click on his or her profile, search for "Github" in the search bar, click on the repo we just created, then clone it to the computer. Voila! The non-technical persona and I would then rejoice in their newfound understanding the creating and cloning Github repos. 

2. Open source means that a piece of software can be customized by it's users. The software's source code is shared to the users and they can make changes like adding new menus, buttons, etc. 

3. I think the idea of open source is a brilliant concept, though one that does make me a bit protective. I think that if I created a piece of software, I would want to be the one to correct and implement changes that my users would want to see. That way, I feel like I'm the actual owner of the software and not everyone else. Conversely, the software might be better served as a tool for others. People could turn it in to what they want/need and most likely improve it in a shorter period of time than I could doing it by myself. It's reassuring to know that there is so much open source software out there and that it's an acceptable practice.

4. Licenses are important because they allow developers to copyright their work, maintain the title of original author or contributor, and regulate restrictions on copying, distributing, and modifying their software. Without the use of a license, developers will not be recognized for their work and will essentially lose any ownership over what they created. In short, use a license!

5. It was nice to go through creating a repo on Github slowly and take some time to review what open source - a term that is on the edge of pop culture vernacular - actually is and why a license is important and matters. I'm not sure if this is considered an "aha" moment, but I found it fascinating to learn that Firefox was created by the Mozilla Foundation (I had always read "Mozilla" but had no idea that it was a non-profit community) and that it is an open source browser. Very cool! I didn't have too many issues in this challenge but I'm sure I'll run into some soon!

6. Aside from the readings listed in the challenge, I read Wikipedia listings for "open source" and "MIT License" - nothing too earth shattering. That being said, I really enjoyed the Skillcrush primers. I thought they did a nice job of presenting the topics clearly and concisely without providing too much information.
