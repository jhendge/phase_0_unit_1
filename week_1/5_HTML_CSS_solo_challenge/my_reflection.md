1. I found myself asking far more CSS questions than HTML ones during this challenge. If I wasn't sure what a pseudo-class link was or forgot positioning syntax, I went to www.css-basics.com first. If I couldn't find anything useful there, I usually checked out http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/. For the part that included a caption on tor of an image, I used this link as a reference: http://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/

2. I just need more time to play with CSS. Being a late admin, I feel compelled to charge through some of this material when I really just want to take some time to play around with it. I don't understand floats wholly and I'd like to know a simpler way of positioning elements (left side of the page, right side of the page, center, etc). I'd also like to play around with 'height' a little bit more because there were a number of times when I thought it would do one thing and it ended up doing another.

3. I learned a bunch of things but two that really stuck out were pseudo classes and line-height. I really liked the process of examining the colors of links and determining how they can be different based on whether or not a user hovers, etc. Line-height is decidedly less sexy but brought the biggest smile to my face when I learned it because all I wanted to do during my first website build was be able to space my lines and now I can finally do it!

4. I feel pretty confident with basic HTML and CSS competencies. Continued practice will certainly fuel my confidence but for now, I'd rather focus on the positives than the things I'm still learning!

5. I enjoyed putting the structure (HTML) of the site together and watching it come alive throughout the process. 

6. I started to get a bit frustrated when I wouldn't understand a piece of CSS or couldn't style something the way I wanted to.
