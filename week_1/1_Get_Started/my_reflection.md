## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

1. I initially setup git and Github and few months ago when I was working the Hartl tutorial (pretty brutal tutorial for a complete beginner!) and don't recall having too much of an issue. I remember going through the git setup not knowing what I was doing or what git was used for, but being pleased that it installed correctly. This time around when I reinstalled git (out of fear that it was somehow not installed on my system anymore...)  I learned a ton about what git actually is (version control!) and what it's used for (more on that below).

2. If I was describing git and Github to a non-technical person, I would say that git allows a group of people to simultaneously work on the same project (even the same parts of the same project) without overwriting each other's work and that Github is where the group can store the project and it's various individual changes and iterations. You can think of a group of people sending physical sheets of paper into an organization funnel (git) and those sheets of paper being stored on a wall with folders (Github).

3. Version control is used by developers to keep track of the changes made to a project. Git is a version control system. Unlike in Microsoft Word where the program keeps track of every key stroke, git will only track changes that are "commit"ed. Github is useful for storing all of the different changes and iterations that are created so that developers can not only reference them, but also sharing them with others who might want to look at and/or work on them.

4. In addition to my answer for #3 above, developers use git in case they make an error in their project and want to start from a previous commit. This is great because if a developer makes a mistake and isn't sure how to fix it or simply does not want to, her/she can begin again from what is essentially a saved version.

5. I understand how multiple people could be working on different parts of the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other, but how can multiple people work on the same parts of the same project simultaneously without overwriting one another? I know that individual copies of each person's changes are saved but who decides which one will be attached to the base file from which everyone is working off of? Or is it not just one file that is selected, but a compilation of files? That isn't completely clear to me!
