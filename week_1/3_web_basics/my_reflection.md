## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. I learned that HTML is not just commonly seen in websites, it is essential to creating them. You can have HTML without a website, but you can't have a website without HTML. I also learned about DNS (domain name system) and how it operates as a phonebook of the Internet. If I wanted to visit techmeme.com, my computer would ask a DNS server for its IP address and then talk directly to the computer to deliver it. Fascinating stuff!

2. When setting up your HTML site, it is important to remember that HTML describes what each part of a web page is to your browser, so be sure to include tags for the headers, body, paragraphs, etc. In addition, it is important to remember that HTML supports many types of content and media (audio, video, images, lists, buttons, etc.) so be sure to utilize those if necessary.

3. I never get tired of the magic of seeing what's produced in code turn in to something tangible and easily digestible. It's really incredible stuff!

4. I did not necessary have an "aha" moment, but I did enjoy the opportunity to review web concepts and technical definitions (see: website vs web application) that I hadn't looked at in years. It was great to refresh my memory.

5. Once again, I was a big fan of the Skillcrush material! I think it's a great primer for any of the topics we have reviewed thus far.
