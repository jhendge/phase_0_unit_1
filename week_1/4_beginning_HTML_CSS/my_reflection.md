## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. One of the things I like so much about HTML is the fact that it is so literal, so basic. The way HTML files are ordered - doctype, html, head, body, headings, etc. - follows a top to bottom ordered progression that makes sense. When I'm writing papers, essays, blog posts, whatever, I always include a title before I begin any paragraphs. HTML follows this logic and it just makes sense to me. 
I feel more comfortable with HTML than I do with CSS. I found the usage of IDs confusing and just felt like there was so, so much more I could do with my page. Knowing myself and how I learn, I'm going to want to see many more examples of CSS code and its output side by side each other so that I can see exactly what the CSS does and produces.

2. In terms of good and bad, it seems good that HTML has a logical structure and is basic in its presentation, making it easier to learn for the masses. In addition, its good that HTML doesn't require any previous knowledge of programming languages.
HTML is also painfully limiting. Certainly more things can be done now with HTML (see: HTML5) than when it was first created, but there was a reason a number of other languages sprouted around HTML - people have different wants and needs that HTML didn't address.

3. The big "aha" moment for me during this series was seeing my webpage come to life. Even though it looks like it was assembled by someone making a website for the very first time (wait, it was!), it really was a joy to see the font styles change in addition to the colors, borders, etc.

4. I was surprised at how inadequate Girl Develop Its Intro to CSS was... I had to check several times to make sure it was the "intro" and not something that assumed prior knowledge. I know that didn't answer the question directly, but I though it might be helpful to know. Another quick bit - other boots have been posting some great stuff on Google+!
