## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

1. Reading about design and user experience helped to reaffirm what I've always believed to be true: design is really, really, *really*, important!

2. I love design and UX. That being said, I don't think I have a natural penchant for it, but I've always been fascinated by it and truly think it is the difference between good and superb site.
Next time, I'd love to try drawing out my wireframes. I think that could be a really awesome experience and I'd love to know which I would prefer.

3. Having worked with but never made a wireframe on my own, I found the links for free wireframing tools posted to Google+ to be tremendously helpful!

4. I was having a little trouble finding appropriate elements on gomockingbird.com but was able to overcome it by combining elements and getting creative.

5. I learned how to use gomockingbird.com!

6. I feel comfortable and confident with the Learning Competencies for this challenge. Let's make some wireframes!

7. I really like to look at things from a 40,000 ft. viewpoint so outlining/wireframing is really helpful for me.

8. I think my wireframes might have been a bit too specific so I found the process of naming specific links and boxes to be a bit time consuming and tedious.
