Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

It was really liberating to read about other people's fears regarding Dev Bootcamp. I saw myself in so many of the emails that I realized we are all made up of similar stuff, but we just look a little bit different on the outside. I have been having a tremendously difficult time grappling with the fact that I'm behind the rest of the group and have really found solace in the posts about fear. Really, what a great exercise. 

This week has made me realize just how kind and thoughtful the Dev Bootcamp staff are. I relayed my concerns about being behind to Kelly and she did a wonderful job of reassuring me that I was not the only one in the boat and that they wouldn't have added me late if they didn't know I could do it. That kind of positive reinforcement made me feel great!
